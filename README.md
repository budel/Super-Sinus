Super-Sinus 
====================

This GUI can be used to simulate wave interferences between multiple sources.



#Usage
For starting you need a version of [MATLAB](http://de.mathworks.com/).
First you have to download the content of the repository, in which this README is available.
Afterwards run superSinusGUI.m to start the GUI.
The Super-Sinus-GUI will appear with a blank space and the opportunity to choose frequency, amplitude and phase is given.<br />
If you click into the blank space without changing any components, the first wave will appear with default values.
You can change them by cklicking into the appropriate field. Then type in your desired value.
Press 'submit' to save your settings.
If a wave was created, you can't change its settings afterwards.
For multiple waves press into the marked space again.
If there are two or more waves, interferences will emerge.
